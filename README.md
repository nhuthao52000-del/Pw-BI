📊 Executive Summary (执行摘要 - Zhíxíng zhāiyào)

1️⃣ Project Context

In the highly competitive Southeast Asian E-commerce landscape, high GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) often masks underlying profitability issues.

Our team developed a strategic Business Intelligence Dashboard for a consumer electronics brand (Model Alpha X) to shift from:

🚀 "Growth at all costs" → 💰 "Profitable Growth"

2️⃣ The Problem (核心问题 - Héxīn wèntí)

Managing cross-border sales involves complex cost variables:

💸 Platform commissions

Without SKU-level visibility, the business was scaling products that were actually generating:

❌ Negative Net Margins

Growth looked strong on the surface. Profitability was deteriorating underneath.

3️⃣ The Solution (解决方案 - Jiějué fāng'àn)

We engineered a centralized data architecture to eliminate fragmented reporting.
